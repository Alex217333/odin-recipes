    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This indulgent Mac and Cheese is easily one of my favorite recipes
            and is loved by everyone in my household. Suitable as a side dish at a 
            gathering or a simple weekday dinner, this has become a mainstay in my 
            recipe rotation.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 lb package of pasta of your choice (my favorites are rotini and elbow macaroni)</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 lb extra sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>8 oz pepperjack cheese</li>
            <li>8 oz colby jack cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon texas pete hot sauce (or equivalent vinegar based hot sauce)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Shred your cheese. Set ~4 oz. of the sharp cheddar to the side. It is important to allow your cheese to sit and come up to room temperature. This will make it much easier to incorporate into your sauce later.</li>
            <li>Melt your butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, stir in your flour in 1 tbsp increments. Once all flour is added, allow to cook for appoximately 1 minute</li>
            <li>Slowly add in your milk and heavy cream, stirring constantly. The goal is to fully incorporate the flour clumps into the milk. Once all the milk is in add your dry spices, salt, hot sauce, and dijon mustard. Allow to simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sauce has thickened. (If you added all the milk and there are still clumps, no worries. Just use an immersion blender to break them up)</li>
            <li>While your sauce is thickening, bring a slightly salted pot of water to boil. Cook your pasta until al dente. I'd recommend 1-2 minutes less than the cook time stated on the side of the box</li>
            <li>After your sauce has thickened, turn off the burner. Add all of your cheese exept the 4oz. set aside earlier in 3-4 batches, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Once your cheese is incorporated into the sauce, add your pasta. Mix until evenly coated, then transfer to a 9x13 cooking dish. Top with your remaining 4oz. of cheddar.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until bubbly. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
