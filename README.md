This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of html and git by giving me a simple but practical task to familiarize me with basic git commands and their workflow. While building the framework for my html files I found that the tags were easier to remember than I anticipated, but I had a bit of trouble deciding when to stage my code and commit it. There were a few revisionary commits that were only necessary because I did not test or review my code before committing them. That is something I will have to pay more attention to.
